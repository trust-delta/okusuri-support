### `/build`
Implements decomposed tasks in autonomous execution mode.
- Review task files
- Automated cycle: task-executor → quality-fixer → commit

- Post-implementation summary and coverage reporting

### `/task`
Executes tasks following appropriate rules.
- Clarify applicable development rules before execution
- Determine initial actions based on rules
- Identify prohibitions to avoid in the task
- Promote metacognition and prevent implementation errors proactively

### `/review`
Design Doc compliance validation with optional auto-fixes.
- Validate Design Doc compliance rate
- Interactive fix confirmation (y/n)
- Execute metacognition before fixes (rule-advisor → TodoWrite → task-executor → quality-fixer)
- Report improvement metrics after fixes

### `/rule-maintenance`
Add, update, and search development rules.

## 🤖 Claude Code Specialized Workflow

### Boilerplate Core: Achieving High Quality with Claude Code

This boilerplate is specifically designed for Claude Code and subagents to generate high-quality TypeScript code.

### Essential Workflow

1. **Initial Rule Loading**: Load necessary rule files (`docs/rules/`) at task start
2. **Pre-Implementation Approval**: Obtain user approval before Edit/Write/MultiEdit operations
3. **Progressive Quality Checks**: Implement Phase 1-6 progressive quality checks
4. **subagent Utilization**: Delegate specialized tasks to appropriate subagents

### Claude Code Development Process

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Load Rules] --> B[Plan Development]
    B --> C[User Approval]
    C --> D[Implementation]
    D --> E[Quality Check]
    E --> F[Commit]
    F --> G{Next Task?}
    G -->|Yes| D
    G -->|No| H[Complete]
```

### Available subagents

- **quality-fixer**: Quality check & automatic correction - Automatically fixes TypeScript project quality issues
- **task-executor**: Individual task execution - Executes tasks according to task file instructions
- **technical-designer**: ADR & Design Doc creation - Creates technical design documents
- **work-planner**: Work plan creation - Creates structured implementation plans from design documents
- **document-reviewer**: Review document consistency and completeness - Validates documents from multiple perspectives
- **prd-creator**: Product Requirements Document (PRD) creation - Creates structured business requirements
- **requirement-analyzer**: Requirement analysis and work scale assessment - Analyzes user requirements and determines appropriate development approach
- **task-decomposer**: Decompose work plans into commit-level tasks - Breaks down plans into 1-commit granular tasks
- **rule-advisor**: Selects minimal effective ruleset for maximum AI execution accuracy
- **code-reviewer**: Design Doc compliance validation - Evaluates implementation completeness from third-party perspective

For details, refer to `CLAUDE.md` and individual definition files in `.claude/agents/` and `.claude/commands/`.

## 📋 Development Rules Overview

This boilerplate provides a comprehensive rule set:

### Core Principles
- **Recommended Format**: Explain prohibitions with benefits/drawbacks (promotes LLM understanding)
- **Flexible Implementation Choice**: Adjustable backward compatibility consideration levels based on project requirements
- **Progressive Quality Assurance**: 6-phase systematic quality check process
- **subagent Integration**: Delegate specialized tasks to appropriate subagents

### Key Rules
- ✅ **Recommended**: unknown type + type guards (ensure type safety)
- ❌ **Avoid**: any type usage (disables type checking)
- ✅ **Recommended**: Test-first development (Red-Green-Refactor)
- ❌ **Avoid**: Commented-out code (use version control for history)
- ✅ **Recommended**: YAGNI principle (implement only currently needed features)

### Rule Index System

The `rules-index.yaml` file in each language directory provides:
- **Metadata**: Description, priority, and keywords for each rule file
- **Dynamic Rule Selection**: AI agents can select appropriate rules based on task context
- **Efficiency**: Load only necessary rules to optimize context usage

### Core Rule Files
1. **technical-spec.md**: Technical specifications, environment setup, data flow principles
2. **typescript.md**: TypeScript development rules (including performance optimization)
3. **typescript-testing.md**: Testing rules & Vitest utilization
4. **project-context.md**: Project context (template)
5. **ai-development-guide.md**: Implementation guide for AI developers & anti-pattern collection
6. **documentation-criteria.md**: Documentation creation criteria (ADR/PRD/Design Doc/Work Plan)
7. **architecture/implementation-approach.md**: Implementation strategy selection framework (meta-cognitive approach)

## 🧪 Testing

### Testing Strategy for Claude Code

This boilerplate is designed for LLMs to implement tests efficiently:

### Running Tests
```bash
npm test                       # Run unit tests
npm run test:coverage:fresh    # Accurate coverage measurement
npm run test:ui               # Launch Vitest UI
npm run cleanup:processes     # Cleanup processes after testing
```

### Test Helper Utilization Policy
- **Builder Pattern**: Simplify construction of complex test data
- **Custom Assertions**: Share common validation logic
- **Mock Decision Criteria**: Share simple and stable mocks, implement complex/frequently changing ones individually
- **Duplication Prevention**: Consider sharing on 3rd duplication (Rule of Three)

### Vitest Optimization
- Process Management: Prevent zombie processes with automatic cleanup
- Type-Safe Mocks: Type-safe mock implementation avoiding any types
- Red-Green-Refactor: Support test-first development

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Claude Code Optimized Architecture

This boilerplate provides architecture patterns that are easy for LLMs to understand and implement:

### Architecture Pattern Selection

`docs/rules/architecture/` contains architecture patterns optimized for LLM development:

#### 1. **Layered Architecture** 
- **Features**: Clear separation of concerns, optimal for enterprise development
- **LLM Benefits**: Clear role definition for each layer, easy to understand
- **Use Cases**: Large-scale, complex business logic

#### 2. **Vertical Slice Architecture** 
- **Features**: One feature per file, optimized for LLM development
- **LLM Benefits**: Efficient use of context window
- **Use Cases**: Claude Code development, feature independence focus

#### 3. **Hybrid Progressive Architecture** 
- **Features**: Progressive evolution from small to large scale
- **LLM Benefits**: Flexible response to project growth
- **Use Cases**: Startups, progressive growth

### Design Principles (LLM Optimized)
- **Clear Separation of Concerns**: One file, one responsibility for context efficiency
- **Dependency Injection**: Testability and easy mocking
- **Type Safety Priority**: Prevent runtime errors with unknown types + type guards
- **YAGNI Adherence**: Avoid excessive abstraction, implement only what's needed
