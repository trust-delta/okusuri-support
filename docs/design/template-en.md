### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements

- [List mandatory functional requirements]

#### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: [Response time, throughput requirements]

## Acceptance Criteria

Define specific and verifiable conditions that determine successful implementation for each functional requirement.
These conditions serve as the basis for test cases and are used to objectively determine implementation completion.
(Note: Checkboxes remain empty at design time as implementation is not yet complete)

- [ ] [Specific acceptance criteria for functional requirement 1]
  - Example: "When user clicks login button, authentication succeeds with correct credentials"
  - Example: "When credentials are invalid, appropriate error message is displayed"
- [ ] [Specific acceptance criteria for functional requirement 2]
  - Example: "Data list screen displays with pagination of 10 items per page"
  - Example: "When input is entered in search field, real-time filtering is applied"
